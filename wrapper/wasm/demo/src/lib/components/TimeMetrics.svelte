            A few notes. <b> Total time </b> is a time from receiving an
            initial message from browser to finishing calculation of a key
            share. <b>Wait time</b> is how much time a node spent waiting
            for a message from other nodes out of <b>Total time</b>. The
            diffence of two is an estimation of CPU time.
